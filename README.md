# rack-jsonp-middleware - ![Travis CI Status](http://travis-ci.org/robertodecurnex/rack-jsonp-middleware.png) - ![Gemnasium Dependencies Status](https://gemnasium.com/robertodecurnex/rack-jsonp-middleware.png)

Rack middleware that turns all .jsonp requests into a jsonp response. 

## Overview

(does not support 'callback' since it is a really generic parameter name)

Btw, don't forget to give a try to [J50NÏ€](https://github.com/robertodecurnex/J50Npi) (a pure JS JSONP helper), they make a lovely couple together :P

## Install

If you are using Bundler you can easily add the following line to your Gemfile:
    
    gem 'rack-jsonp-middleware'

Or you can just install it as a ruby gem by running:
    
    $ gem install rack-jsonp-middleware

## Configuration

### Rails 3

In your `config/application.rb` file add:
    
    require 'rack/jsonp'

And, within the config block:
    
    config.middleware.use Rack::JSONP

Here is an exelent example of this - [Rails 3 Configuration Example](https://github.com/rwilcox/rack_jsonp_example/commit/809c2e3d4470b694ba1a98c09f2aa07115f433e5 "Rails 3 Configuration Example")

Thank you [rwilcox](https://github.com/rwilcox "rwilcox profile")! 

### Rails 2

Same as for Rails 3 but modifying the `config/environment.rb` file instead.

### Rack Apps

In your `config.ru` file add the following lines:
    
    require 'rack/jsonp'
    use Rack::JSONP

## Download

You can also clone the project with Git by running:
    $ git clone git://github.com/robertodecurnex/rack-jsonp-middleware

## Examples

Given that http://domain.com/action.json returns the following:
    {"key":"value"}
With the following Content-Type:
    application/json

Then http://domain.com/action.jsonp?callback=J50Npi.success will return the following:
    J50Npi.success({"key":"value"})
With the following Content-Type:
    application/javascript

But http://domain.com/action.json?callback=J50Npi.sucess will still returns the following:
    {"key":"value"}
With the following Content-Type:
    application/json

# Security

Supporting jsonp means that another websites can access your website on behalf of a user visiting their site,
which might lead to security problems (e.g. they read http://yoursite.com/user.jsonp and get the users email etc),
so think about if you want to turn it on globally.
